# BARN-DOOR-PROJECT
BARN DOOR WEBSITE

First website I made for a small interior company in Slovakia.
A static multi-page website made mainly with HTML5 and CSS3 and a sprinkle of JS.

I learned to plan ahead with structuring the html skeleton, think good and hard what names to give to classes and ids, my limits in visual design and applied my first JS.
It took me way longer than anticipated for the main part because of the frequent updates and changes the client had during the many meetings, but the joy of delivering a final product was well worth it.

Maybe two years after finishing this website and a year since I got a job as a web developer and boy oh boy, is this code garbage!
